## Purpose of the Project: 

- Writing is a cohesive form of communication that can effectively convey our thoughts. Typing and writing are the standard methods of recording information today. Characters or words are written in the free space with a marker or finger. It differs from traditional writing methods in that the pen does not move up and down. With the development of intelligent wearable devices, the digital world can now be controlled by human gestures. These wearable devices can recognize and understand our actions. Recognizing and interpreting a continuous sequential gesture stream from the given set of input data is gesture recognition. Gestures are non-verbal information used to improve computer language understanding. Human gestures are perceived by vision, and computer vision is used to analyze various gestures. The project takes advantage of this gap and focuses on developing a motion-to-text converter that can potentially serve as a software for intelligent wearable devices for writing from the air. The system will use computer vision to trace the finger's path, and in that way, one can write from above. The generated text can also be used for various purposes, such as sending messages, e-mails, etc. It will be a powerful means of communication for the deaf. It is an effective communication method that reduces cellphone and laptop usage by eliminating the need to write.

## Target Beneficiary:

- Drawing or Sketching using hand is everyone’s wish. Some or the other time we imagine writing in air using our hand. So, here came the project from this concept where we create a canvas and pick the colours required using our hand and draw the required design or write anything you wish.

## Project Scope:

- To ensure that, the interface is very simple and easily understandable by the user.
- The user should be able to draw what he wishes to draw without any interruptions.
- In future, this is useful for making kids to learn drawing in schools in an interactive way.
